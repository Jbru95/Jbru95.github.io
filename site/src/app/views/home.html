<h2>About Me</h2>

<div style="font-size: 1.4em; margin-left: 80px; margin-bottom: 36px;"> 
    <p>
        My name is Jayson Armbruster, and I am a Software Engineering professional living in Metro Detroit, Michigan. I graduated from Michigan State University's College of Engineering in 2018, with a degree in Applied Engineering Sciences, Specializing in Computer Science.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am currently employed by Jervis B. Webb Company in Novi, MI as a Software Engineer, mainly developing User Interface Software for the Airport Baggage and Materials Handling industries.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my free time I enjoy watching sports, especially the Detroit Tigers, Detroit Lions, and Michigan State Spartans in Football and Basketball, and spending time with my friends and family.  In addition, I also enjoy spending time developing any software projects I'm working on, and researching new technologies that I can integrate into both my professional and personal projects.
